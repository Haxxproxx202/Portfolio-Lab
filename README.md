## Donation App

The donation app offers users a wide range of foundations to support with their contributions.
To get started, users need to create an account and verify it by clicking a link sent to their
email. When making a donation, users are prompted to fill out a form with all the necessary
details. Users can keep track of their donations by viewing a list of their past contributions
in their profile section and archiving any that they wish for future reference.
